//! `shimmer-fetchers`: reaching outward -- scheduling, dedup, backoff (CLAUDE.md §8, ADR
//! 0028). Rate limiting and caching are not this module's job; they live behind `ctx.http`
//! (ADR 0027).
//!
//! [`source`] is the `Source` trait (ADR 0028 §2); [`sources`] holds one file per
//! implementation -- `hn-whoishiring` (`Method::Api`) and `weworkremotely`
//! (`Method::Scrape`), both reference sources from ADR 0028 §10. [`dedup`] has the
//! per-source "seen" bookkeeping and [`RunGuard`](dedup::RunGuard), the overlap guard
//! (ADR 0028 §4, §5). [`http`] is the retry wrapper around `ctx.http.get` (ADR 0028 §6);
//! [`html`] and [`robots`] are the scraping and robots.txt helpers `weworkremotely` uses,
//! since `Method::Scrape` is responsible for checking robots.txt itself (ADR 0028 §7).
//! [`module`]'s `Fetchers` wires all of this together: `fetchers.tick` finds due sources
//! and enqueues `fetchers.fetch` for each, which runs the matching `Source`, dedupes its
//! items, and emits `fetchers.item.found` for each new one.
//!
//! Depends on `core` only.
