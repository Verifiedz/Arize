//! The workspace state machine (CLAUDE.md §10.3): plain data and plain transition functions,
//! no `Ctx`, no I/O (§12 rule 10). Each transition takes the current state and returns the
//! next one, or an error if it does not apply. Never a panic: the module answers the error.
//!
//! Who can cause a wrong transition decides the error code (issue #30):
//! - a user request that doesn't fit the state (e.g. `reset` on a workspace that isn't dirty)
//!   is `invalid_params` with a message saying why; activating one that is already launching
//!   is `conflict`;
//! - a transition only the module itself drives (`launch_succeeded`, `step_failed`) arriving
//!   in the wrong state is a bug in the module: `internal`.
