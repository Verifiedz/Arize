# 0028. The fetchers module: `Source`, scheduling, dedup

Status: proposed · Raised by Dev A (taking over the `fetchers` module from Dev B's territory
per handoff) · Needs sign-off: Dev A · Dev C notified (protocol change: a new op, two payload
shapes — see §9) · No `core` change · Amended (issue #127, source kinds): §2's `Source::id()`
signature and the registry's construction model change — see §2a. Still no `core` change and
no `docs/protocol.md` change — `fetchers.item.found`'s payload shape (§3) is unaffected.

## Context

`fetchers` is the last unbuilt host module from CLAUDE.md's M6 scope (CLAUDE.md:831). ADR
0027 (`docs/decisions/0027-real-http-gateway.md`, merged via PR #109) already built the part
of this that used to be fetchers' own job — rate limiting, caching, redirects, cooldown —
behind `ctx.http`. What ADR 0027's own "Dev B's side" section left for this module: `Source`,
scheduling and dedup (`docs/decisions/0027-real-http-gateway.md` §"Dev B's side").

Everything here lives inside `crates/modules/fetchers`, `core`-only, because
`.dev/check-deps.py` grants a `module`-role crate a dependency on `core` alone and bans
module-to-module dependencies outright (`.dev/check-deps.py:27-36`) — there is nowhere else
in the dependency graph for a `Source` impl or a scraping helper to live.

## Decision

### 1. Crate and dependency shape

`crates/modules/fetchers`, one new workspace member, `core`-only. One registration line in
`crates/app/src/main.rs:95` (`Arc::new(shimmer_fetchers::Fetchers::default())`), the same
shape the two existing modules already use there.

### 2. The `Source` trait — paginated, in-crate, method-tagged

```rust
pub enum Method { Api, Scrape }

pub struct Page { pub items: Vec<RawItem>, pub next_cursor: Option<String> }

pub struct RawItem {
    pub source_id: String,   // dedup key (§4) -- never a content hash
    pub title: String,
    pub url: String,
    pub raw_data: Value,     // capped, see §3
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait Source: Send + Sync {
    fn id(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn method(&self) -> Method;
    async fn fetch_page(&self, ctx: &Ctx, cursor: Option<&str>) -> Result<Page>;
}
```

The host loops `fetch_page` up to a fixed max-pages cap, following `next_cursor` until it's
`None` or the cap is hit. One trait, no API-then-scrape fallback inside a single `Source` —
a source that genuinely wants both is two `Source` impls, each ~40 lines, matching CLAUDE.md
§8's "one `impl Source` of about forty lines."

### 2a. Amendment (#127): source kinds and a config-driven registry

**Why.** §2's own answer to wanting a variant — "two `Source` impls" — is fine for "API vs.
scrape of the same site," but doesn't scale to "watch five RSS feeds" or "two job-board
searches for two companies." Raised in review of the fetchers PR stack (#116–#126); full
reasoning in issue #127.

**Trait change.** `Source::id` stops returning a `'static` string:

```rust
pub trait Source: Send + Sync {
    fn id(&self) -> &str;    // was: &'static str
    fn method(&self) -> Method;
    async fn fetch_page(&self, ctx: &Ctx, cursor: Option<&str>) -> Result<Page>;
}
```

A runtime-built instance can't hand back a `&'static str` for an id it only learns from
`config.toml`. `hn-whoishiring`/`weworkremotely` need only this mechanical signature change
— each still returns its existing literal, which borrows fine as `&str` — nothing else about
either one moves. No `core` change: `Source` lives entirely in `crates/modules/fetchers`.

**Config change.** `SourceConfig` (§5) gains an optional `kind`:

```toml
[modules.fetchers.sources.hn-whoishiring]
enabled = true
interval = "daily"            # no `kind` -- this id must already exist in the fixed,
                               # compiled-in registry (unchanged, today's behavior)

[modules.fetchers.sources.my-team-blog]
kind = "rss"                  # `kind` present -- the registry builds a brand-new
enabled = true                # instance of this kind, with this id and this entry's
interval = "hourly"           # own settings, instead of looking up a built-in
url = "https://example.com/feed.xml"
```

`kind` absent means today's path exactly: the id must resolve against the fixed, compiled-in
list (`hn-whoishiring`, `weworkremotely`), checked at load time (already shipped: a
misspelled or unknown id with no `kind` is rejected at `FetchersConfig::from_value`, not left
to fail `not_found` on the first tick). `kind` present means a new instance, validated the
same way — a kind's own required fields (e.g. `rss`'s `url`) must be checked at load time
too, not discovered lazily on first fetch.

**Registry becomes two-layered**, not a single flat list:

1. The fixed, compiled-in sources (`hn-whoishiring`, `weworkremotely`) — unchanged, always
   present, no `kind` needed, exactly as §2/§10 describe them today.
2. A config-driven layer: for every `[modules.fetchers.sources.<id>]` entry that has a
   `kind`, dispatch on that string (`"rss"` → build an `Rss` instance; any other value is
   rejected at load time, same as an unknown interval preset) to construct a `Source` with
   this entry's id and params.

**Id collision is rejected, not shadowed.** A config entry whose `kind` is set and whose id
equals one of the fixed, compiled-in ids (e.g. `[modules.fetchers.sources.hn-whoishiring]`
with `kind = "rss"`) is a load-time error, the same `invalid_params` path as an unknown
`kind` or a missing required field — never a silent shadow of the built-in. The two layers
share one id namespace; a `kind`-bearing entry only ever *adds* an id, it never overrides
one the fixed layer already owns. (Validation code lands in the sibling PR, #131, not here.)

This needs no `core` change — the registry is built where `fetch()` already holds a `Ctx`,
not inside `Module::triggers()` (§5's finding about `triggers()` having no config access is
unaffected and unrelated to this).

**The `rss` kind (issue #127, first batch — `json-api`/`html-list` are a later batch, not
decided here):**

- Settings beyond `enabled`/`interval`/`kind`: one required field, `url` — the feed's URL,
  RSS or Atom. Checked at load time per the same "a kind's own required fields are checked
  at load time" rule stated above, and checked as more than "non-empty": `url` must parse
  as a well-formed `http://` or `https://` URL. Empty, malformed, or a non-`http(s)` scheme
  (`ftp://`, `file://`, etc.) is a load-time `invalid_params` error, same as a missing
  `url` entirely. (Validation code lands in #131, not here.)
- Parsing via **`feed-rs` 3.0.0** (MIT, pure Rust — no `-sys` dependency in its tree
  (`chrono`, `mediatype`, `quick-xml`, `regex`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `siphasher`, `url`,
  `uuid`, `ammonia`) — handles RSS 0.x/1.0/2.0 and Atom from one parse call, 2.4M downloads,
  last published 2026-09-27 — verified live against crates.io on 2026-10-07, same bar §7
  already held `scraper`/`texting_robots` to.
- `Method::Api`, not `Scrape` — a feed URL is a known, fetcher-maintained endpoint the same
  way `hn-whoishiring`'s Firebase API is (§10); it is not a crawled site in the robots.txt
  sense, so no robots.txt check applies.
- Dedup key (`RawItem::source_id`): the entry's own `id`/`guid` field when the feed sets one,
  else its `link` URL. Stated now so this isn't invented differently mid-implementation.
  **Caveat found during #131's implementation:** `feed-rs` does not leave an entry's `id`
  empty when the underlying feed omits one — it synthesizes a non-empty id itself (a hash
  of link+title, or, when an entry has neither, a **random UUID that changes on every
  parse**). Taking `feed-rs`'s id at face value would make such an entry look "new" on
  every single run, defeating the entire point of dedup. So the `rss` kind must not use
  `feed-rs`'s default id generation: it overrides it with its own `id_generator`
  (`feed_rs::parser::Builder` supports supplying one) so the fallback is deterministic —
  always the entry's own first `link` when there is no feed-supplied id, never a random
  value — and an entry that still has neither a usable id nor a link is skipped rather than
  ever emitted with an unstable key. (Implemented in #131, not here.)
- Pagination: out of scope for a feed. `fetch_page` returns every entry the feed has in one
  `Page` with `next_cursor: None`, always a single page.

**Orphaned per-source state on removal is fine, left as-is.** When a configured `kind`
entry is later deleted from `config.toml`, its `data/fetchers/<id>/seen.toml` and its entry
in `last_run.toml` are left behind on disk, unreferenced by anything. This is expected and
acceptable, not a leak to fix: CLAUDE.md's "SQLite is disposable" philosophy (§1.4) doesn't
apply to these — they're files, not the derived index — but the underlying principle does:
unreferenced state just sits unused, it does not corrupt anything or affect a source that
is still configured. No automatic cleanup is done, and none is proposed here; a user who
cares can delete the directory/entry by hand, consistent with "files the user could edit by
hand" (CLAUDE.md §1.4).

**Not done in this amendment:**

- The `json-api` and `html-list` kinds — a later batch (issue #127, umbrella PR's own
  done-when).
- Migrating `hn-whoishiring`/`weworkremotely` onto the new kind system — they stay hand-written
  `Source` impls exactly as today; only `id()`'s return type changes.
- §7's per-method rate-limit floor (currently a uniform, provisional 900s) — a kind-aware
  registry could eventually expose each instance's `Method` to the scheduling layer and make
  this precise, but that's not decided or built here.
- CLI/TUI surface — already out of scope per this ADR's "Not done here"; unchanged.

### 3. Item event

`fetchers.item.found` payload: `{source_name, source_id, title, url, raw_data}`. `raw_data`
capped at 8 KiB — enough for a job posting's text, small enough that one large item can't
turn into the next cache-bloat problem. This is a protocol.md addition (§9).

### 4. Dedup

`data/fetchers/<source>/seen.toml`: a map `id -> last_seen` (RFC3339), through `ctx.store`,
never the index (CLAUDE.md §1.4/§7 — nothing that isn't a file is truth). One
`ctx.store.transaction` per **run**, not per item: the final `seen.toml` is written once and
`tx.emit("fetchers.item.found", ...)` is called once per new item inside that same
transaction — the pattern `records::import` already uses for "many writes, many events, one
transaction" (`crates/modules/records/src/lib.rs:864-872`). This makes "a failed or partial
run never prunes" free: nothing commits until the whole run's result is known.

Pruning: at the end of a successful run, drop `seen.toml` entries whose `last_seen` is older
than 90 days. Per-run cap: at most 50 new items processed (and thus emitted) per run; items
beyond the cap are left unmarked and picked up by a later run — see §7.

### 5. Scheduling

**Finding:** `Module::triggers()` is `fn triggers(&self) -> Vec<TriggerSpec>` — synchronous,
`&self`-only (`crates/core/src/module.rs:25-27`) — called once at registry-build time,
*before* `Config::load` and *before* `Module::init(&ctx)` run
(`crates/daemon/src/lib.rs:95-96,98-102,120`). Module construction is also config-blind
(`crates/app/src/main.rs:95`, plain `::default()`). So a literal "one `TriggerSpec` per
*configured* source" is not implementable: nothing at the point `triggers()` runs has seen
`config.toml` yet. This is reported, not worked around by changing `core` — no `core` edit is
in this ADR.

**Decision:** one fixed `TriggerSpec` — a heartbeat, needing no config to exist:
`op: "fetchers.tick"`, `lane: "fetchers"`, `catch_up: Skip`, default period 300s. Its handler
(which gets a full `Ctx`, including `ctx.config`) reads `[modules.fetchers]` on every firing
and decides which sources are due, tracking each source's own `last_run_at` itself in
`ctx.store` — not the scheduler's per-trigger bookkeeping. This gives correct catch-up
behaviour at the *source* level for free: a "daily" source whose last run was 3 days ago
(daemon asleep) is simply overdue whenever a tick notices it, however many ticks were
skipped getting there. `fetchers.tick` is a protocol.md addition (§9) — discoverable like
any op via `core.manifest`, even though only the scheduler calls it in practice.

Config lives in the already-generic `[modules.fetchers]` section (plain JSON via
`ModuleConfig`, `crates/core/src/ctx.rs:30-51`) — unlike `[http]`
(`crates/daemon/src/config.rs:97-99`), which the daemon parses specially because the real
`HttpBackend` must exist before any `Ctx`, module config needs no daemon change at all:

```toml
[modules.fetchers]
tick_interval_s = 300

[modules.fetchers.sources.hn-whoishiring]
enabled = true
interval = "daily"        # a preset, or an integer seconds count >= the method's floor

[modules.fetchers.sources.weworkremotely]
enabled = false
interval = "daily"
```

Presets: `hourly` = 3600, `daily` = 86400, `weekly` = 604800. Floors (§7): 1800s for `Api`,
21600s for `Scrape`. Sources default **disabled**. Overlap guard: an in-process
`Mutex<HashSet<SourceId>>` on the `Fetchers` struct — the same shape as `records`'
`WriteLock` (`crates/core/src/sync.rs:13-20`), but keyed. `fetchers.fetch`'s handler tries to
insert the source id and fails fast (`module_error`) if another run (tick-triggered or
manual) already holds it; the tick handler additionally skips enqueuing a source it already
sees as running, as an optimization only, not the actual guarantee.

### 6. Retry

`ctx.http.get` returns `Ok(HttpResponse)` for *every* in-band HTTP status, including
4xx/429/503 (`crates/core/src/http.rs:14-26`; `crates/daemon/src/http_backend.rs`'s `finish`
and cooldown paths never return `Err` for a status code) — only a transport-level failure is
`Err(unavailable)`, and only `Unavailable` is retryable
(`crates/core/src/error.rs:98-99`). So the module's retry wrapper branches on `resp.status`
itself:

```rust
let resp = ctx.retry_with_backoff(RetryPolicy::standard(), |_| async {
    let r = ctx.http.get(&url).await?;
    if r.status >= 500 { return Err(Error::unavailable(format!("http {}", r.status))); }
    Ok(r)
}).await?;
```

A `retry_after_secs` on the result means the gateway has this host in cooldown: stop this
source's run now, no further attempt, let the next tick try again. A `4xx` is a terminal
failure for this run (`reason: "http_error"`, no retry). `RetryPolicy::standard()` (3
attempts, 1s/2s, `crates/core/src/retry.rs:15-17`) is already documented as "what a fetcher
wants" — reused as-is.

### 7. Scraping and politeness

A shared parse helper inside the crate, built on **`scraper` 0.27.0** (pure Rust, ISC
license, 31M+ downloads, actively maintained, no system/C dependency — verified live against
crates.io; builds identically on `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml:10`). `select_or_fail(doc, selector, what)` returns
`Err(module_error)` when a selector matches zero elements on an otherwise-200 response — a
distinct `reason: "parse_empty"` in `fetchers.fetch.failed` (§9), so a source's health is
visible instead of silently reporting "0 new items" the same way a genuinely quiet board
would. JS-rendered pages are out of scope; a headless-browser subprocess is a follow-up (its
own ADR — §12 rule 8 bans raw process spawning outside `Launcher`, itself gated to the
`"process"` capability only `workspaces` uses today).

Politeness lives in **fetchers**, not the gateway: robots.txt is a crawling-ethics judgment
tied to "is this traversing a site's pages," which only a `Source` can know, and ADR 0027 is
already merged scoped to rate-limit/cache/redirect only. Applies to `Method::Scrape` sources
only, fetched once through the existing `ctx.http` (so it gets the same cache/rate-limit
treatment as everything else) via **`texting_robots` 0.2.2** (pure Rust, zero dependencies,
dual MIT/Apache-2.0 — verified live, more recently touched than the alternative `robotstxt`
crate). A `Disallow` match is a hard refusal, never a soft warning. User-Agent identifies the
bot by default (`Shimmer-Fetchers/<version>`, overridable in config), never spoofs a browser.
Scrape sources get the longer config floor from §5 as their "more conservative default
interval."

### 8. First-run flood

The per-run item cap (§4) is the whole mitigation: a board with hundreds of unseen items on
first contact surfaces only the cap's worth per run; the rest stay unmarked and are picked
up on later ticks, spreading both the event volume (against the 1024-event per-connection
backpressure queue, `docs/protocol.md:175`) and the event-log growth across time instead of
one burst. Not hypothetical: the reference HN source (§9) can have 500+ top-level comments
on one month's thread, each needing its own fetch — at `ctx.http`'s default 2 req/s per
host, an uncapped cold-start run would take minutes before the event-queue angle is even
considered.

### 9. Protocol changes needed (additive, Dev C notified)

- New op `fetchers.tick` (§5) — scheduler-only in practice, discoverable like any op.
- `fetchers.item.found`'s actual payload (§3) — the existing illustrative example
  (`docs/protocol.md:550`, `{"source":"hn-whoishiring","id":"c-41883"}`) is superseded by
  `{source_name, source_id, title, url, raw_data}`.
- `fetchers.fetch.failed`'s payload gains a `reason` enum:
  `"network" | "http_error" | "parse_empty" | "cancelled"`, plus `{source, error, attempt}`.

### 10. Reference sources

Both public, no login, no API key, verified live on 2026-10-06:

- **`hn-whoishiring`** (`Method::Api`). Hacker News's official, public, unauthenticated
  Firebase API (`hacker-news.firebaseio.com`). No robots.txt applies — it's an API host, not
  a crawled site, and the API is explicitly meant for third-party clients. Flow:
  `user/whoishiring.json` for submitted story ids → the latest "Who is hiring?" thread →
  `item/<thread>.json`'s `kids` as the paginated item list → one `item/<id>.json` fetch per
  comment. HN states no hard rate limit beyond "be reasonable"; `ctx.http`'s own per-host
  default (2 req/s) is the actual governor.
- **`weworkremotely`** (`Method::Scrape`). `weworkremotely.com/categories/*`: confirmed
  static, server-rendered HTML (fetched and read listings directly out of the raw page, no
  JS needed). `robots.txt` is `Allow: /`, disallowing only `/admin/`, `/account/`,
  `/job-seekers/.../profile`, `/manage-company/` — the category paths used here are not
  disallowed. No login wall. No `?page=` on a category page (confirmed: 48 jobs, no visible
  pager), so pagination walks the site's own category slugs
  (`remote-programming-jobs` → `remote-devops-sysadmin-jobs` → …) as the trait's
  `next_cursor`, rather than inventing a page number the site doesn't have.

## Not done here

- Credentials/secret storage for a future authenticated source. **Not** blocked by the
  `Source` trait or the `[modules.fetchers.sources.*]` config shape (both take `ctx`, which
  can carry a key via `ctx.config` later). **Is** blocked by `HttpBackend::get`'s current
  signature (`crates/core/src/http.rs:29-32`), which takes no custom headers — no module can
  set an `Authorization` header through `ctx.http` today. ADR 0027 already named this as its
  own open question ("Not done here": "Request headers on `HttpBackend::get`... deferred
  until a real consumer defines the actual need"). A credentialed source needs that ADR's
  follow-up before it can exist, regardless of anything here.
- `records` inbox/triage (matching a found item to a saved record) — a `records` feature,
  separate from this module.
- TUI surface, CLI surface (`crates/cli` commands for `fetchers.*`) — out of scope for this
  ADR.
- Headless-browser scraping for JS-rendered sites.
- A `core` change that would let `Module::triggers()` read config directly (§5's finding) —
  would affect every module, not just this one; not proposed here.
