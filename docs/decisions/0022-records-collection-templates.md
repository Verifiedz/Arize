# 0022. Collection templates: ready-made trackers created with one command

Status: proposed · Raised by Dev B (records roadmap, item 1; issue #78) · Needs sign-off: Dev A
(two new ops in `records`, docs/protocol.md) · Dev C notified · No `core` or `proto` change

## Context

CLAUDE.md §1 calls Shimmer "a records engine that a LeetCode tracker is a forty-line
configuration of", and §8 lists what that engine is for: job applications, LeetCode, OSS repos,
outreach, career fairs, saved links. Today a fresh install has one collection, LeetCode, seeded
on first start (ADR 0008), and **no op creates another**: a job tracker means learning the
collection format and writing a file into `data/records/collections/` by hand.

ADRs 0016–0021 gave collections what real trackers need: titles, deadline and URL roles, unique
fields, `repeat_complete`, generated ids, queries, safe removal and reference lists. This ADR
packages that into templates, starting with job hunting, the use case Shimmer's M6 story is
built around (§1.3: an OA deadline turns into a notification).

## Decision

### 1. A template is an ordinary collection file

Built-in templates live in `crates/modules/records/templates/<id>.toml`, compiled into the binary
with `include_str!`. Each is a normal collection file (ADR 0008 and everything since) whose
`[collection] id` is the template's own id. There is no second format: the collection parser
checks templates, and a template is exactly the file the user gets.

`leetcode.toml` moves from `collections/` into `templates/`. Seeding on first start (ADR 0008)
uses it from there and behaves exactly as before.

### 2. Two ops

| Op | Params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `records.templates` | `{}` | `{"templates":[…]}`: each template as `records.collections` shows a collection, sorted by id |
| `records.create_collection` | `{"id","template","label"?}` | the new collection, as `records.collections` shows it |

`records.create_collection`:

- `id` must be a valid collection id (`invalid_params`), so a request can never name a path
  outside `collections/`.
- `template` must exist, or `not_found` naming the ones that do.
- **Never overwrites.** If `collections/<id>.toml` exists, even malformed, it is `conflict`.
- **The template's text is copied, comments and all**, with only `[collection] id` (and `label`,
  when given) changed, using the same comment-keeping edit as ADR 0021.
- **Checked before writing**: the result goes through the collection parser. A template that
  would produce an invalid collection is a bug and fails loudly instead of being written.
- **One transaction** writes the file and emits `records.collection.created` with
  `{collection, template}` (the topic seeding already uses).
- The result **forgets it came from a template**: it is the user's file, edited like any other,
  and later improvements to the template never change it.

### 3. The first set

**`job-applications`**: one record per job you're tracking.

- `title = "{company}: {position}"`.
- `status`: `todo` = saved, not applied yet; `done` = applied. `records complete` stamps
  `applied_on`, and `repeat_complete = "refuse"`: applying happens once.
- Fields: `position`*, `company`* (required); from the posting, `url` (role `url`, `unique`, so
  the same posting can't be saved twice), `employment_type`, `level`, `location`, `job_id`,
  `term`, `duration`, `salary`, `applicants` (how many have applied, from the posting site),
  `posted_on`, `description`; for your own tracking, `stage`,
  `priority`, `source`, `referral`, `apply_by`, `oa_deadline`, `follow_up_on` (all three role
  `deadline`, so the calendar can remind you), `applied_on`, `notes`.
- `stage` is the coarse pipeline *after* applying (`screening`, `assessment`, `interviewing`,
  `offer`, `accepted`, `declined`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`, `ghosted`; empty = waiting), in
  that order, so `--filter "stage>=interviewing"` and `--sort stage` follow the pipeline (ADR
  0019). Whether you applied is `status`, not a stage.
- A heatmap view on `applied_on`.
- `related = ["interviews", "interview-questions"]`.

**`interviews`**: one record per round, any number of rounds of any kind.

- `title = "{application}: {kind}"`. `records complete` = the round happened (stamps `done_on`,
  `repeat_complete = "refuse"`).
- Fields: `application`* (the job record's id: plain text until reference fields exist, roadmap
  item 13), `kind`* (`recruiter-screen`, `oa`, `take-home`, `case-study`, `technical`,
  `system-design`, `behavioral`, `hiring-manager`, `team-match`, `other`), `round`,
  `scheduled_on` (role `deadline`), `format`, `interviewer`, `prep`, `duration_min`,
  `questions_asked` (what came up, as text), `went` (your read: `great` … `poor`),
  `difficulty`, `outcome` (their decision: `waiting`, `passed`, `failed`), `feedback`,
  `thank_you_sent`, `next_step`, `done_on`, `notes`.
- `related = ["job-applications", "interview-questions"]`.

**`interview-questions`**: a question bank to practise from, one record per question.

- `title = "{question}"`. `records complete` = "practised it today" (stamps `last_practiced`)
  and `repeat_complete = "restamp"`: every practice counts, like solving a problem again, and a
  heatmap shows practice days.
- Fields: `question`*, `kind`* (`behavioral`, `coding`, `system-design`, `technical`, `resume`,
  `hiring-manager`, `other`), `difficulty`, `topic`, `company`, `asked_in` (the round's id, when
  you were asked it), `asked_on`, `source` (`asked-me`, `glassdoor`, `leetcode-discuss`, …),
  `url`, `answer` (your outline or STAR answer), `story` (which of your stories you'd tell),
  `went` (how it went when asked), `confidence` (`shaky`, `okay`, `solid`), `next_review` (role
  `deadline`: when to practise again), `last_practiced`, `notes`.
- `related = ["interviews", "job-applications"]`.

A round (`interviews`) and a question (`interview-questions`) are kept apart on purpose: one
round asks several questions, and the same question comes up at many companies, so a question
is practised, filtered and timed on its own. `questions_asked` on a round is the quick record;
the question bank is where the ones worth practising live.

Each template's comments explain its fields and how completing works, since the file is the only
documentation the user will open.

### 4. CLI

```
$ shimmer records templates
ID                   LABEL                DESCRIPTION
interview-questions  Interview questions  A question bank to practise from: kind, topic, your answer, …
interviews           Interviews           One record per interview round, linked to a job application
job-applications  Job applications  Position, company, stage, deadlines and the date you applied
leetcode          LeetCode          Problems by difficulty, with a heatmap of solves

$ shimmer records new jobs --from job-applications
✓ created collection jobs from job-applications
  add one: shimmer records add jobs --position … --company …
  goes with: interviews (shimmer records new interviews --from interviews)
  goes with: interview-questions (shimmer records new interview-questions --from interview-questions)
```

- `records new ID --from TEMPLATE [--label TEXT]`. `--from` is required: a collection with no
  fields is not useful, and the list is short.
- **No pack aliases** for these two: setting up a tracker is occasional, like the commands in
  ADR 0021 §6.

### 5. The convention for templates in any module

Workspace templates (#68) and any later kind follow the same rules, so people learn them once:

1. `shimmer <thing> templates` lists them; `shimmer <thing> new <id> --from <template>` creates
   one. The ops are `<module>.templates` and a create op in the same module.
2. **Each module owns its templates.** A module can only write its own namespace and can't call
   another (CLAUDE.md §1.3, §5), so there is no shared "templates" module.
3. Built-ins are **embedded in the binary**, and a test creates every one.
4. Creating **never overwrites** (`conflict`), is **checked with the module's normal parser
   before writing**, and writes everything in **one transaction with one event**.
5. The result is **ordinary data** that forgets where it came from.

No code is shared yet: the overlap is a lookup of a few lines. If workspace templates repeat it,
it moves into `core` then, with an ADR, as ADR 0014 did for other helpers.

## Consequences

- `crates/modules/records`: a `templates/` folder (with `leetcode.toml` moved in), the two ops,
  a test that creates every template and checks it, op tests against the in-memory `Ctx`
  (§12 rule 13).
- `crates/cli`: `records templates`, `records new`.
- `docs/protocol.md`: both ops; `records.collection.created` gains `template`.
  `crates/mockd/fixtures/core.json` lists the ops. Dev C told.

## Not done here

- **More templates**: the rest of §8's list (`oss-contributions`, `outreach`, `career-fairs`,
  `reading-list`, `saved-links`). Each is a new file in `templates/`, no code (roadmap item 14).
  The background-info templates (`education`, `employment`, `addresses`: reference lists with
  `completable = false`, ADR 0021) followed in their own PR, as data files only.
- **User templates** in `$SHIMMER_HOME`, and a community template repository.
- **Kits** that create several collections and a workspace together (#79).
- **Reference fields** so `interviews.application` is a real link (#80).
